#Fort.js

[![CDNJS](https://img.shields.io/cdnjs/v/Fort.js.svg)](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Fort.js)

Modern progress bar for form completion.
All you do is add the form and Fort.js' algorithm will take care of the rest. Best of all, it's super small. [Check out the demo!](http://idriskhenchil.github.io/default/index.html)

##Usage
Using Fort is so simple, it's simple. All you do is insert `fort.min.js` and `fort.min.css` into the `<head>` then pop in an `<input>` into `<div class="form">`. Anything outside of the `<div>` won't count. Now you just call the effect (Scroll down to the the "Effects" section for more). Yep, that's all there is to it. Fort does the rest.
```html
<head>
  <script src="fort.min.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="fort.min.css">
</head>
<body>
<div class="form">
  <form method="post">
    <input type="text">
  </form>
</div>
  <script>
      Fort.flash("#009DFF", "#000", "#6638F0");
  </script>
</body>
```

**Certain fields:**

If you want to include only certain fields add a class named `ignore` to the field. Fort will not detect the field after you do so.
##Effects
 * [Default](http://idriskhenchil.github.io/default/index.html) - `solid()`
 * [Gradient](http://idriskhenchil.github.io/gradient/index.html) - `gradient()`
 * [Sections](http://idriskhenchil.github.io/sections/index.html) - `sections()`
 * [Flash](http://idriskhenchil.github.io/flash/index.html) - `flash()`
 * [Merge](http://idriskhenchil.github.io/merge/index.html) - `merge()`

**Changing the colors:**
* Solid - `Fort.solid("#009DFF")` Keepin' it simple

* Gradient - `Fort.gradient("#009DFF", "#47B9FF")` Note that only two values should be passed.

* Sections - `Fort.sections("#009DFF", "#4AF2A1", "#FB5229")` The more colors you add, the more sections you get!

* Flash - `Fort.flash("#009DFF", "#000", "#6638F0");` Old school, yet unique.

* Merge `Fort.merge("#009DFF");` *Tip*: Add a few more colors and see what you get (Not 100% tested)

##Custom Configuration
Fort.js now supports custom configuration, which offers the following properties

`height`: Height in any CSS notation

`duration`: Any time like '3s' or '200ms'

`alignment`: Bottom or top

**Example**

    Fort.config({
    	height: '20px',
    	duration: '3s',
    	alignment: 'bottom'
    })
    
**Please note an effect must also be selected**
